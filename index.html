                         I am a committed and motivated honors scholar at a large state college with an interest
                         in combining STEM and business principles in the realm of Information science and International
                         business. I want to become a data scientist that will help discover the information hidden in today's vast amounts of data, 
                         and help make smarter decisions to deliver even better story-telling. My primary focus will be in applying data mining techniques, 
                         doing statistical analysis, and building high quality prediction systems.
